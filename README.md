# Maze Adventure

Term project for the course Programming Methodology

### Steps to run the game:

1. If it's right after you cloned the repository, run `make setup`. This will setup a virtual environment and install the required dependencies
2. `make` or `make run` to run the game and enjoy :)

### Guideline for developers:

- Setup the environment with `make setup`
- If new dependencies are installed into the project, run `make update` to update the `requirements.txt` file for synchronized development
- To upgrade the dependencies' versions, run `make upgrade`
